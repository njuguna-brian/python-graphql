## What is Strawberry?

Strawberry is a Python library for building GraphQL APIs. It's built on top of
GraphQL Core and supports both async and sync execution. It also has
integrations for Django and other frameworks.

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries
with your existing data.

GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your
API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more,
makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

## Why GraphQL?

GraphQL was created by Facebook in 2012 and open-sourced in 2015. Since then it
has been adopted by many companies, including GitHub, Shopify, and Twitter.
